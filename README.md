## Introduction
Project Sidelined aiming to utilize React and Redux in a final project for the courses at DigitalCrafts. The project is mean to accent many of the teachings and techniquesthat I have acquired during my time in the course. I aimed to do a project that would exciting to develop as it would be to visit.

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

## General Info
Project Sidelined consist of 3 components. The Sidelined card games, which part engage in a game of wit, gamesmanship, and tactics. The How To Page, which gives a run down on different components on how to play. And the final component is the the About page, which gives a basic rundown of my inspiration for creating the project and a few of my favorite links.

### The Sidelined Card Game
Played over 3 rounds: the objective is to have the most coins at the end. Each player is dealt 3 cards from a deck of 10 cards. You are then able to select a card, a wager amount, and a prediction on if you are going to win or lose.

The system mirrors the Rock Paper Scissors Model to reduce the chance of a tie. To add additional complexity to the game is a wager system. Simply winning the battle is not enough, calling you opponents bluff and using deduction to try to predict the result of the battle is the key to victory.

Using the information tools available to you to understand the options that are available to you and what your opponent may play is the key to victory. Dynamically adjusting statistical information is present to help make information decisions. Careful before your opponent is aware of this as well.
